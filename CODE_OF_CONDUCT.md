# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders of the **upchunks microservice API** community, pledge to make participation
in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. We welcome individuals regardless of age,
body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We commit to fostering an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community environment through our
actions and interactions.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment in our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness towards others
- Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and accepting constructive feedback graciously
- Taking responsibility for our mistakes, offering apologies, and learning from experiences
- Focusing on the greater good of the community, not solely on personal interests

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Using sexualized language, imagery, or making sexual advances
- Engaging in trolling, insults, derogatory comments, or personal attacks
- Harassment in any form, publicly or privately
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected
to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code,
wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily
or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the
project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by <a href="mailto:zhid0399123@gmail.com">contacting the project team</a>.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate
to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions
as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
